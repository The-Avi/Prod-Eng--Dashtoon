# Prod-Eng--Dashtoon
The project is a web-based Comic Strip Generator designed to allow users to create and view a 10-panel comic strip by inputting text. The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can enter text for each panel, and upon submission, the text is sent to an external API that generates images representing each panel of the comic strip.

**Key Features:**

-User Interface: The web application features an intuitive and responsive user interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a form that allows users to input text for 10 comic panels.

-API Integration: The application integrates with a text-to-image API to convert the entered text into visual comic panel images. Upon successful API calls, the generated images are displayed within the application.

-Error Handling: To provide user feedback for failed API calls or internal errors, the application handles exceptions and displays appropriate error messages to guide users on potential issues or failures during the comic generation process.

**Functionality:**

-Input Text for Comic Panels: Users can input text for each of the 10 comic panels using a form provided on the web page.

-Image Generation: Upon form submission, the entered text for each panel is sent to the text-to-image API. The API processes the text and generates corresponding images for the 10 comic panels.

-Display of Comic Strip: The generated comic strip images are displayed on the web page within a designated container, allowing users to view the comic strip they've created.

-Error Feedback: In case of failed API calls or errors during the generation process, the application provides feedback to the users by displaying error messages, informing them about the issue and suggesting potential troubleshooting steps.

**Technologies Used:**

-Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

-Frameworks/Libraries: Bootstrap (for styling), Fetch API (for API requests)

-API Integration: Utilizes an external text-to-image API for generating comic strip panels.

**User Experience:**

The Comic Strip Generator aims to provide a seamless and engaging experience for users interested in creating their own 10-panel comic strips. The intuitive interface simplifies the process of inputting text, generating comic panels, and viewing the final comic strip. Additionally, the error feedback mechanism ensures users are informed in case of any issues encountered during the generation process, enhancing the overall usability of the application.
